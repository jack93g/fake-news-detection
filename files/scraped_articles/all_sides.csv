The court's decision to consider the issue on an unusually accelerated schedule ramps up the drama over abortion, as the justices prepare to hear an even more consequential case a month from now. On Dec. 1, Mississippi will urge the court to overrule Roe v. Wade and declare that there is no constitutional right to abortion. The cases Monday involve two challenges to the..."

The order, which Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from, leaves intact a decision earlier this month by a federal appeals court that revived the law, SB 8, two days after a judge in Austin blocked it. It means that healthcare providers in Texas will remain barred from performing nearly all..."

In a marathon three hours of oral arguments today, the United States Supreme Court continued its rapid handling of a controversial Texas law that effectively outlaws abortion in the state.

The Supreme Court heard oral argument on Monday in two challenges to S.B. 8, the Texas law that bans almost all abortions in the state. After nearly three hours of argument by four different lawyers, the justices appeared likely to allow the case brought by a group of Texas abortion providers to go forward, even if they did not necessarily appear to agree on the rationale for that lawsuit. The justices were more skeptical about the lawsuit filed by the Biden administration, and they did not give any hint as..."

The focus will not be on abortion rights, per se, but on the controversial Texas law designed to prevent court challenges. At issue is whether a state can nullify a constitutional right — in this case the right to abortion — by delegating enforcement not to state officials, but to private citizens who are authorized to sue abortion providers and anyone else who aids or abets an abortion.

Have you ever thought about why the polar bear is the mascot of choice for the climate movement? Once upon a time, our conception of environmental protection was quite different from what it is today. During President Teddy Roosevelt’s time in the early 1900s, for example, hunters were widely regarded as upstanding individuals who cared for the land and animals they were among so often. Ranchers and farmers had their place in environmental conversations because, after all, they spent their entire lives tending to nature. Environmentalism was an issue advocated..."

The court decision freeing Bill Cosby is a train wreck. It’s also probably correct. Bill Cosby, the disgraced comedian who was convicted of sexual assault in 2018, is no longer in prison, due to a state supreme court decision in Commonwealth v. Cosby. The circumstances that freed him involve a stunning display of prosecutorial incompetence, a divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court that split three ways on what should become of Cosby, and a long, rambling judicial opinion that is often difficult to parse. The thrust of that opinion is that, even though then-Montgomery County District..."

On july 27th a juryless court in Hong Kong convicted Tong Ying-kit, a 24-year-old waiter, of terrorism and inciting secession.

The central bank is expected to announce this week plans to begin withdrawing its massive support for the economy, the first step in winding down the historic cash infusions it launched to save markets during the pandemic.

Just over the past week, a billionaire wealth tax proposal has suddenly moved from the edge to the very center of the negotiating table for President Biden’s sweeping Build Back Better agenda. What explains the shift? The reasons are both negative and positive. On the negative side: Kyrsten Sinema. Last week, the Arizona Senator took a break from high-roller fundraising to inform her colleagues that she opposes even partially undoing the tax rate cuts on corporations and wealthy individuals that Republicans enacted (and she voted against) in 2017. This sent..."

When it comes to the deficit, Americans have endured a remarkably consistent pattern for four decades. It starts with a Republican presidential candidate denouncing the deficit and vowing to balance the budget if elected. That Republican then takes office, abandons interest in the issue, and expresses indifference when the deficit becomes vastly larger. Then a Democrat takes office, at which point GOP lawmakers who didn't care at all about the deficit suddenly decide it's a critical issue that the new center-left president must immediately prioritize. During the Democratic administration, the..."

Claim: The Biden Administration’s American Families Plan proposes that financial institutions report all transactions from personal and business accounts except those below $600.

But shortly after the idea was raised, it was axed thanks to opposition among key party members, specifically Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The proposed tax was designed to close pathways that have allowed a small number of the country’s richest people to accumulate enormous wealth while paying a lower effective tax rate than most working Americans.

The Biden administration had proposed requiring financial institutions to report more information about bank accounts to the IRS, in cases where the accounts had more than $600 in withdrawals and deposits in a year.

Experts expect to see average inflation of 5.25% in December, slightly down from the current maximum predicted 5.4% figure, according to The Wall Street Journal. If inflation stays around its current level, Americans will experience the longest period during which inflation has stayed above 5% since 1991. “It’s a perfect storm: supply-chain bottlenecks, tight labor markets, ultra-easy monetary and fiscal policies,” Michael Moran, Daiwa Capital Markets America’s chief economist, told the WSJ.

Why it matters: Legitimate cases are being dismissed. And critics say the Federal Election Commission's inability to crack down on many bad actors has undercut the threat of enforcement, and turned campaign financing into the Wild West.

If you have been anywhere within range of conservative talking points on either side of the Atlantic during the past few months, you are surely aware that “anti-wokeness” has become central to the right’s assault on their political enemies. There are various explanations for this phenomenon, ranging from not-so-secret pandering to racism and sexism to the absence of a substantive conservative agenda these days. Personally, I think it’s catnip for the right in no small part because it enables culture warriors fighting such strange ideas as equality to pose as..."

I intended to duly fulfill my duty as a political columnist and write about the first 100 days of Joe Biden’s presidency. My idea was to focus on the 50 Senate Democrats: They don’t have a single vote to spare, they have to broker deals that satisfy both Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin — America does have a multiparty political system, it’s just tucked inside the Senate Democratic caucus — and yet they’ve held together pretty well, on a pretty ambitious agenda.

Is there a crisis at the U.S.–Mexico border? It depends on your definition of crisis. The monthly number of individuals being apprehended there for unauthorized crossings is higher than it was two years ago, pre-coronavirus, and given seasonal trends this summer’s totals might end up being higher than those observed at any point during Donald Trump’s term. But on an absolute basis there are still fewer crossings being documented than there were during the summer of 2019, and many fewer than were routinely recorded during the first decade of the..."

A weird thing happened right after the Nov. 3 election: nothing. The nation was braced for chaos. Liberal groups had vowed to take to the streets, planning hundreds of protests across the country. Right-wing militias were girding for battle. In a poll before Election Day, 75% of Americans voiced concern about violence. Instead, an eerie quiet descended. As President Trump refused to concede, the response was not mass action but crickets. When media organizations called the race for Joe Biden on Nov. 7, jubilation broke out instead, as people thronged..."

As Congress began the process of formally confirming Joe Biden’s presidency on Wednesday, President Donald Trump falsely claimed victory at a rambling, delusional last-ditch rally in front of thousands of protesters gathered in front of the White House. The unprecedented split screen was the culmination of Trump’s futile monthslong campaign to overturn the results of the November election. Trump attacked his own “weak” Republican Party, ran through a long litany of false allegations of election fraud, and urged his vice president, Mike Pence, to illegally reject states’ Electoral College votes."

Possibly. But the reality is that slogans and rhetoric make very little difference in elections. Tuesday’s big flap was an interview at Vox with James Carville, who accused Democrats of being too “woke” and using “faculty lounge” language instead of rhetoric voters like. Kevin Drum adds: “one thing that’s clear is that Republicans sure think that attacking wokeness is a winning strategy.” I’m not so sure. The truth is that all the rhetoric probably doesn’t matter much. If the economy is doing well, then the president’s party benefits. Voters tend..."

In our world where agreement, especially among the politically fractured media, is rare, there seems to be a general consensus on one thing: President Joe Biden is governing further left than expected. From The New York Times on the left to the National Review on the right, the press is in general agreement. But is Biden uniting or dividing the country while he moves left? Biden’s inaugural address sounded notes of unity, but historically that has been a standard feature for new presidents, with the noted exception of President Donald..."

President Joe Biden is breaking one of his central campaign promises, surely upsetting progressives who wanted Biden to unilaterally cancel the massive bill of student loan debt that Americans have accumulated. As of June 2020, outstanding federal student loan debt was $1.57 trillion, which included nearly 43 million borrowers.

Recently, James Carville, the unfrozen Clintonite of Democratic politics, stirred a predictable controversy by complaining about “wokeness” in an interview with Sean Illing of Vox. Everyone has a different definition of the term, but Carville’s was one you hear a lot from strategically minded Democrats: Wokeness is “faculty lounge” rhetoric, the language of elite hyper-educated progressivism, entering into mass politics in a way that turns a lot of normal people off. Framed this way, intra-Democratic debates about the new progressivism often boil down to word choice and emphasis. Do you..."

Late last month, Americans learned of the latest twist in the efforts of death penalty states to keep their execution machinery running when the Guardian revealed Arizona’s plan to revive the gas chamber. This news followed on the heels of continuing moves by the state’s Republican officeholders to resume putting inmates to death after a seven-year hiatus.

When it comes to history, the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.  A few years ago, I was awestruck when NBA guard Jarrett Jack wore a T-shirt to commemorate the study of Black history during the month of February.

The only thing tragic about the death of Donald Rumsfeld is that it didn’t occur in an Iraqi prison.

An actuarial table of the deaths for which Donald Rumsfeld is responsible is difficult to assemble.

Tuesday night was a disaster for Democrats nationally. Period.

Against that backdrop, the Washington state Democrat has become a prominent voice for the party's left flank and liberal policies as chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

The House voted 220 to 212 on a key procedural motion to instruct committees to write the $3.5 trillion bill, which can pass both Congressional chambers without any Republican support. To placate the centrist Democratic holdouts, Speaker Nancy Pelosi committed to a Sept. 27 deadline to vote on the $550 billion Senate-passed infrastructure bill.

But it's far from a done deal: The path is murky in the House, where some Democrats are rebelling.
The vote was 66 to 28, signaling broad support in the Senate for a deal led by Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to authorize $110 billion for new roads and $39 billion for public transit, among many other provisions."

Decades of climate activism have gotten millions of people into the streets but they haven’t turned the tide on emissions, or even investments. Citing a 2019 study in the journal Nature,..."

The $1.2 trillion plan, which includes $579 billion in new spending, will largely focus on America’s physical infrastructure like roads, bridges, airports and public transportation.

Urbanists lament the fact that the average American knows and cares little about the built environment, but this sad reality has a significant upside. Because urban policy is a relatively fringe topic, it presents what is in today’s political climate a rare opportunity: the chance to make converts to conservative principles through rational persuasion.

Last month, we warned Republicans about the pitfalls of indulging President Biden’s infrastructure fantasies. The bipartisan framework announced Thursday isn’t causing us to change our mind. There is much to dislike about the so-called compromise proposal (even putting aside the minor detail that the nation’s infrastructure is not, in fact, in dire need of repair). The deal negotiated by a group of five Republicans and five Democrats would mean $579 billion in new spending that, when slapped on top of what the federal government is already slated to spend on infrastructure, could mean $1.2..."

The perennial dilemma for congressional progressives has always been that while they have a working moral conscience, their opponents don’t. This fundamental quandary is at work yet again, as progressives, after gamely holding the line for months on the Democrats’ infrastructure bills, are now coming under intense pressure to swallow another loss, smile, and say thank you.

The US economy grew at an annualized rate of only 2% in the third quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday. The highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus, supply chain chaos, worker shortages, sluggish jobs numbers and higher prices weighed on economic activity.

Then a Democrat takes office, at which point GOP lawmakers who didn't care at all about the deficit suddenly decide it's a critical issue that the new center-left president must immediately prioritize.

President Biden’s recent announcement that he struck a deal with one of the nation’s largest ports to increase output and alleviate our nation’s growing supply chain crisis is nothing more than a headline. It’s a pebble tossed in a fast-moving river. Alas, even the positive spin Team Biden hoped to gain from that event was quickly overshadowed by the news that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg — the government official charged with keeping his eye on this exact ball — has quietly been absent from his office since mid-August."

Since President Joe Biden took office, his administration has canceled billions of dollars in student loan debt. Most recently, in early October, the Education Department announced sweeping changes to its Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, immediately erasing the debt of 22,000 borrowers. Now some social media users say it's in the federal government's best financial interest to go ahead and cancel all student loan debt.

The massive Democratic spending package now working its way through Congress is not, strictly speaking, a health care bill. But it's not not a health care bill, either. Many of its biggest, most expensive provisions are expansions of government-run or federally subsidized health care programs.

Just two provisions alone would cost about $533 billion, according to a new analysis by the..."

Joe Biden suffered his first major political lashing as president Tuesday.

Democrats say they’re working hard to pare back their $3.5 trillion tax and spending bill to $2 trillion to please House and Senate dissenters, but don’t believe it. What they’re really doing is working hard to pack $4 trillion in new programs into a $2 trillion disguise that sounds less radical than it is. That’s the message from news reports that the White House on Tuesday offered Congressional Democrats a plan that retains nearly all of the entitlement programs they originally proposed. Instead of reducing this vast expansion of the..."

On the opening day of the 26th international climate conference in Glasgow, President Joe Biden’s pitch to the world was, more or less, to trust that the US would lead on the climate crisis. Biden originally hoped to arrive in Scotland with a pair of laws in hand that marked the US’s most significant investment ever in the climate crisis. Instead, he brought a smattering of executive actions and pledges, while his main agenda remains a moving target in Congress.

As President Joe Biden limps into Glasgow, there are only two things holding back his big, showy climate agenda: politics and economics. If you happen to be one of those people who insists that climate change should be “beyond politics,” then you are certainly entitled to the sentiment — but spare us any lectures about “democracy” in the future, because politics is how liberal-democratic societies go about their public business. And the politics here do not favor dramatic action, whatever is said or notionally agreed to in Glasgow. Joe Biden and..."

Carbon dioxide gets the fame and attention of the greenhouse gases.

The United States is finally taking aim at an important type of these lesser-known superpollutants: hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are used in air conditioners and refrigerators.

Why it matter: The spike in the number of people who solely identify as Native American or Alaska Native mirrors the steady rise of the population since 1890, when Indigenous people were nearly wiped out in the U.S. The Native American population was reduced to fewer than 250,000 people before the 20th century, following decades of mass extermination, forced boarding schools and..."

476,Asian Americans Disprove CRT,National Review,https://www.allsides.com/news/2021-08-25-0930/asian-americans-disprove-crt,"OPINION
According to the illiberal race-hustlers among us, America is a thoroughly racist nation where you only succeed if (and because) you are white. Therefore, we need government to coercively redistribute wealth and allocate important positions by racial quotas. Only through such measures can we attain “equity.” That theory collapses when examined with any care. A person’s race or ancestry has nothing to do with his success or failure in life. In today’s Martin Center article, Kenny Xu demolishes critical race theory by pointing out that Asian Americans have enjoyed great success..."

Samuel Paty was decapitated on Oct. 16, 2020, outside the middle school in a north Paris suburb where he had taught history and civics for five years.

The magazine was the target of a high-profile Islamist terrorist attack back in January 2015 that spurred a month’s long wave of jihadi violence across the country. In a..."

“Facebook isn’t killing people,” Biden said.
Biden added that he hopes Facebook will do more to fight “the outrageous misinformation” about coronavirus vaccines being spread on its platform “instead of taking it personally that somehow I’m saying Facebook is killing people.”"

Right-wing media are attacking President Joe Biden’s child tax credit program, which aims to drastically reduce childhood poverty and act as a life raft to families as financial difficulties caused by the pandemic persist. In spite of the program’s popularity and widespread benefits, coverage by conservative media aims to undermine its utility and exaggerate its perceived social and economic detriments.  Dominant right-wing media narratives include asserting that the tax credits will worsen the ongoing labor shortage by providing Americans “another reason not to go back to work”; claiming the credits..."

A family court judge in Chicago denied a mother the right to custody over her son until she gets vaccinated against COVID-19, the implication being that an unvaccinated parent is not a fit parent. The ruling didn't hold long—the judge himself quickly reversed course—but the initial decision will be chilling for thousands of parents across the country. Making parental or child vaccination a requirement for custody would be an enormous judicial and government overreach, setting a dangerous precedent for intervention into what has traditionally been the realm of the family. This case..."

Last week, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a provision, to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act, that would require women to register with Selective Service, that is, the military draft. This is a grave mistake, but not a surprising one. Requiring women to register with the Selective Service has long been avoided by lawmakers, even as they have gradually eliminated exclusions aimed at shielding women from exposure to direct combat, in part due to its abiding unpopularity. In 2016, however, the last of these restrictions was removed, opening combat arms..."

Before parents consent to vaccinate their children against COVID, basic medical ethics requires that they be informed of how safe the vaccine is.

This time Democratic leaders believe they have a secret weapon: Biden himself. Biden will join House Democrats on Capitol Hill Thursday morning for a high-stakes sales pitch to resistant progressives, asking them to support a bipartisan infrastructure framework, although a final agreement on the party's broader social spending bill remains out of reach without clear liberal buyin.

When it comes to the deficit, Americans have endured a remarkably consistent pattern for four decades. It starts with a Republican presidential candidate denouncing the deficit and vowing to balance the budget if elected. That Republican then takes office, abandons interest in the issue, and expresses indifference when the deficit becomes vastly larger. Then a Democrat takes office, at which point GOP lawmakers who didn't care at all about the deficit suddenly decide it's a critical issue that the new center-left president must immediately prioritize. During the Democratic administration, the..."

Congressional Republicans suspect the Biden Treasury Department’s decision is part of a package of concessions meant to entice Iran into resuming negotiations aimed at securing a return to the nuclear deal—though senior U.S. officials dispute this claim, saying that the sanctions were removed following an internal legal review.

To the extent President Biden’s pull-out from Afghanistan was not criminally negligent, it was pervasively mendacious. There was the president’s lamebrained targeting of September 11 as the withdrawal deadline — a strategic and propaganda boon for the Taliban. There was the stunningly backward plan to draw down forces before evacuating civilians and diplomats, which led to the mind-blowing Bagram bug-out. Thus the domino effect of U.S. mistakes: our inability to evacuate from a fortified, well-equipped airport, instead shifting operations to the impractical Kabul airport; our removal of the technical support (especially air support) that the Afghan..."

For a country that purports to value our First Amendment right to freedom of speech, it has become clear that some of our elected officials don’t understand it.   State legislatures across the country have passed bill after bill that violate the First Amendment’s free expression protections – protections that limit the government’s ability to infringe on individuals’ speech.  Yet a recent survey by the Freedom Forum of more than 3,000 Americans found that 94% value the First Amendment as vital, and more than half say it should never be altered.   Now..."

Where once the left fought the bosses in the workers’ name, today its loudest voices lobby bosses to police workers. If you are trying to understand why this section of the left is hated, its authoritarianism is a large part of the answer.

Many school districts across the country are in the grips of a full-blown moral panic, supposedly over something called ""critical race theory"" (CRT). Fox News has been blaring deranged propaganda about CRT for months. In Loudon County, Virginia (home to many Republican political professionals), angry conservatives deluged a recent school board meeting, and were so loud and disruptive that two were eventually arrested. Similar stories can be found in Maine, Texas, Pennsylvania, and many other states."

Rose in Asheville, N.C., found her world capsized. Various friends and relatives had stopped speaking to her because she was a cop. During a protest in June around Police Headquarters, a demonstrator lobbed an explosive charge that set her pants on fire and scorched her legs. She said she was spit on. She was belittled. Members of the city’s gay community, an inclusive clan that had..."

In 1963, Walter Gadsden, 15 years old, was attacked by a police dog during a protest on the streets of Birmingham, Alabama. The moment was captured by Bill Hudson of the Associated Press. His photograph was later said to have brought the world to the side of the civil rights movement—a grand claim but not an unreasonable one, given both the photo’s mass circulation and the meanings ascribed to it by white audiences. Gadsden was a “frail Negro,” in one description; full of “saintly calm,” in the words of Diane McWhorter,..."

It has now been a year since white police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for approximately nine minutes, while a crowd of bystanders begged him to spare the 46-year-old Black man’s life. In the immediate aftermath of the killing, while the coronavirus pandemic was still ravaging communities, thousands of people in every single state took to the streets to protest what took place in Minneapolis and the structural forces that led to it. Former president Donald Trump’s excessive and violent response only seemed to further legitimize the actions of the protesters. And..."

When Michael McQuarrie entered the George Floyd Square autonomous zone for the first time last year, he felt as if he was entering a freer, friendlier, and, in some ways, edgier America. To some, the neighborhood had become the “Free State of George Floyd.” To him and many there, it proved more broadly that a community can not only function, but thrive, without police authority: that physical autonomy empowers citizens. And then there were the gun shots. “Policing in Black and trans communities has been so brutal over 30, 40..."

Marches and protests spanned every U.S. state – a massive expression of public concern but also a movement perceived by some to be violent.  In January Rep.

They’re not controversial. It’s common sense. It’s something that everyone can agree with, but it blunts the messaging the progressive Left wants to echo about police and the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s like when the Left gets upset when people say that ‘most cops are good.’ The Left wants to destroy policing, liking it to slave patrols. As former police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison for his part in the killing of George Floyd last year that set off a summer of leftist violence,..."

Consequences matter. If there was one clear message from football’s temporary boycott of social media earlier this month, in protest at the torrent of online hate experienced disproportionately by black players, that was it. The former England striker Ian Wright has said that he’d almost given up reporting the vile stuff he receives daily because nothing ever seemed to happen to the perpetrators. “It makes you feel very dehumanised. You feel like there’s nothing you can do, you’re helpless,” he said. So two cheers, at least, for the inclusion in..."

For nearly all its history, the Supreme Court kept its distance from gun policy. Now it’s about to decide a case that could radically reduce the government’s power to regulate guns. The Second Amendment states explicitly that it exists to protect “a well regulated Militia,” and until fairly recently, the Court took these four words very seriously. As a unanimous Court explained in United States v. Miller (1939), the “obvious purpose” of the Second Amendment was to “render possible the effectiveness” of militias, and the amendment must be “interpreted and applied with that..."

Mexican officials, assisted by the gun-control group Brady United, filed a lawsuit against several U.S.-based firearm manufacturers alleging that these companies encouraged gun trafficking into Mexico. Mexico seeks $10 billion in damages and injunctive relief. They claim the firearm manufacturers are responsible for the rampant crime, corruption, and uncontrolled murders being committed in Mexico by Mexican drug cartels. These allegations are baseless. The Mexican government is responsible for its failure to enforce its own laws and control rampant crime and corruption within its own borders and government. The lawsuit is the anti-gun..."

That’s the message from news reports that the White House on Tuesday offered Congressional Democrats a plan that retains nearly all of the entitlement programs they originally proposed.

The move comes after a Trump-appointed federal judge sided with the states of Texas and Missouri in a lawsuit challenging the termination of the program and ordered the administration to reinstate it “in good faith.” The government is appealing the ruling and drafting a memo to once again rescind MPP, meanwhile, it’s also hiring contractors to rebuild tent courts in Laredo and Brownsville..."

The U.S. war on immigrants is worsening the labor shortage. But some Americans would rather destroy the supply chain and shutter industries than admit it – and do something about it. Evidence of scarce workers is everywhere. Shipping containers remained unopened from Los Angeles to Georgia. Restaurants, hotels, trucking and other industries are begging for workers. The Wall Street Journal reports that “employers are struggling to fill more than 10 million job openings and meet soaring consumer demand.” Industries hardest hit by a record number of workers quitting include manufacturing, retail, trade, transportation and utilities.

The continuing migrant saga at the U.S.—Mexico border seems to have boxed the Biden Administration into a corner where it is not effectively and humanely dealing with migrants. Instead, the migrants are being turned away by two Biden enforced immigration policies that originated under previous administrations. The first is the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy that requires migrants to stay in Mexico until their U.S. immigration court date. This policy enables migrants to make a claim to asylum in the United States, but requires them to await the determination of the..."

Just days away from pulling its last troops out of Afghanistan following 20 years of protracted war, the U.S. faces a new terrorist threat: Islamic State-Khorasan Province.

Israel’s new governing coalition may not hold, and Bibi could reemerge amid the chaos.

The race is now on for “the end of Bibi” editorializing — mostly by individuals who have opposed Netanyahu and who are euphoric about his purported fall. Certainly Netanyahu’s polarizing personality and his tendency to alienate many of his closest associates have played a significant role in his..."

Benjamin Netanyahu showed the opposite of grace as he exited from power on Sunday. If you want to evaluate his legacy on the basis of his final day in office, you will mark him down as one of history’s sorest losers.  History will likely tell a very different story, one that cites Netanyahu’s time in office from 2009 onward as a hinge moment in history itself — as a period during which Israel moved beyond the existential drama of its first 60 years and established itself as an enduring, undeniable and formidable permanent..."

The number of women in prison has skyrocketed over the last 40 years.

This year alone, state legislators have introduced nearly 600 abortion restrictions, with more than 90 becoming law, according to Planned Parenthood. Some of these laws,..."

An NBC News reporter worked to find excuses Monday for President Joe Biden’s apparent cat nap during speeches at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.  Biden, who warned military service members this summer that top Pentagon officials consider climate change to be the ""greatest threat"" to America’s national security in the coming years, sat with his arms crossed, looking like he was drifting in and out of sleep, in a viral video shared by Washington Post reporter Zach Purser Brown. MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell welcomed NBC News senior White House reporter Kelly O’Donnell to her program..."

The media pile-on atop Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase ""Republicans seize"" unironically, and taking at face value..."

As whistleblowers continue to dump documents revealing internal Facebook discussions about controlling content, one thing is striking: The thousands of pages released so far contain zero signs of staff worries about (or even awareness of) left-wing hate speech and misinformation. Perhaps we’re only seeing part of the picture. But Facebook staffers’ incessant drive to censor right-wing stories and sites suggests they really are blind to the often-outrageous speech from outlets on the other side of the spectrum. The Wall Street Journal’s blockbuster report this week detailed how the social-media giant’s “employees have consistently pushed to suppress or de-platform..."

But now it faces a combination of all three at once in what could be the most intense and wide-ranging crisis in the company's 17-year history. On Friday, a consortium of 17 US news organizations began publishing a series of stories — collectively called ""The Facebook Papers"" — based on a trove of hundreds of internal company documents which were included in disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel.

Even as most Americans are still learning about the hacking-for-cash crime of ransomware, the nation’s top homeland security official is worried about an even more dire digital danger: killware, or cyberattacks that can literally end lives. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in April galvanized the public’s attention because of its consumer-related complications, including long lines at gas stations, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with USA TODAY's Editorial Board last week.

Facebook, the social media behemoth with more than 2.8 billion users worldwide, has been weathering storms of criticism ever since its founder Mark Zuckerberg began it as an online project connecting college students in 2004.  But the 17-year-old company newly rebranded as Meta – which also includes Instagram and WhatsApp, with their billions of global users – is now confronting an unprecedented level of scrutiny after a former Facebook employee secretly copied tens of thousands of pages of the company’s internal research.

After publicly promising to crack down, Facebook acknowledged in internal documents obtained by The Associated Press that it was “under-enforcing on confirmed abusive activity” that saw Filipina maids complaining on the social media site of being abused.

There’s a misconception that legacy media is an arm of the Democratic Party. There’s also a misconception that legacy media is pro-corporate. It’s true that legacy media is almost always pro-Democrat and almost always pro-corporate. But last week’s Netflix dust-up clarified something important. In recent weeks, Matt Taibbi and Katie Herzog have documented the egregiously bad coverage of Netflix’s internal turmoil over “The Closer,” Dave Chappelle’s latest special for the streamer.

The continuing migrant saga at the U.S.—Mexico border seems to have boxed the Biden Administration into a corner where it is not effectively and humanely dealing with migrants. Instead, the migrants are being turned away by two Biden enforced immigration policies that originated under previous administrations. The first is the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy that requires migrants to stay in Mexico until their U.S. immigration court date. This policy enables migrants to make a claim to asylum in the United States, but requires them to await the determination of the..."

Mexican officials, assisted by the gun-control group Brady United, filed a lawsuit against several U.S.-based firearm manufacturers alleging that these companies encouraged gun trafficking into Mexico.

Testimony from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday was enlightening in several respects. The two defense officials may not have persuaded those who wanted to continue an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, but they certainly put President Biden’s decision-making in context.

Congressional Republicans suspect the Biden Treasury Department’s decision is part of a package of concessions meant to entice Iran into resuming negotiations aimed at securing a return to the nuclear deal—though senior U.S. officials dispute this claim, saying that the sanctions were removed following an internal legal review. Diplomatic talks with Iran have stalled since the regime inaugurated a new..."

President Biden hopes the political fallout from his botched Afghanistan withdrawal will fade quickly, but Tuesday’s Senate hearing with the secretary of Defense and two top generals doesn’t cast his decisions in a better light. The hearing underscored that the President acted against the advice of the military in yanking the residual U.S. force from the country. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and Gen. Kenneth McKenzie both made clear in their testimony that they recommended that about 2,500 U.S. troops stay in Afghanistan to delay..."

When then-President Trump ordered a strike that killed two leaders of two terrorist organizations with zero collateral damage, many in the media, academia, and Hollywood immediately condemned it as impulsive and dangerous. When President Biden ordered a drone strike against alleged ISIS-K members that instead killed an aid worker and his family, the reaction in those same quarters amounted to barely a reprimand. The study in contrasts underscores just how differently the two presidents’ actions are filtered through the media and academia prisms. Trump’s attack on January 3, 2020, killed the Islamic..."

A booster stack, which is the rocket used to accelerate the projectile to hypersonic speeds, failed and the test of the projectile, the hypersonic glide body, could not proceed, the statement said.

It’s not really clear what the utility is of Christopher Steele speaking out now, long after his dossier of unverified claims about Donald Trump and Russia colored Trump’s presidency — and especially with Trump now out of office. Steele had declined to speak publicly on the situation for most of five years, but he’s now the subject of a Hulu documentary, and ABC News has published an interview with Steele. Or put more precisely, it’s not clear what the utility is of it beyond Steele trying to defend his good name with..."

The costs and consequences of the United States’s twenty-first-century wars have by now been well-documented — a staggering $8 trillion in expenditures and more than 380,000 civilian deaths, as calculated by Brown University’s Costs of War project. The question of who has benefited most from such an orgy of military spending has, unfortunately, received far less attention. Corporations large and small have left the financial feast of that post-9/11 surge in military spending with genuinely staggering sums in hand. After all, Pentagon spending has totaled an almost unimaginable $14 trillion plus since the start..."

Testimony from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday was enlightening in several respects. The two defense officials may not have persuaded those who wanted to continue an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, but they certainly put President Biden’s decision-making in context. Much of the media’s attention focused on Milley, who at the beginning of the hearing shattered the notion that he had acted outside the chain of command or usurped civilian control in the waning days of..."

On August 29, a US drone strike killed 10 members of one family in Kabul. That same day, the Pentagon announced that the operation successfully targeted a suicide bomber affiliated with ISIS-K, who had allegedly filled a car with explosives as part of a suspected plan to attack the Hamid Karzai International Airport, where US troops raced to complete their evacuation operation a day before their deadline.

Pentagon airstrikes against Iran-backed militias in Syria are not only the first military action taken by President Joe Biden.

Now that George W. Bush is back in the news with his attacks on Trumpist insurrectionists, it might be worth reviving one of the great lines of his presidency. After the September 11 attack, when Bush decided to go after not just the terrorists who planned the hijackings, but all sorts of people around the world he didn’t like, he lumped them together as “evildoers.” That may not be the most eloquent phrase, but it works well as a description of the modern pharmaceutical industry.

Multiple people who have expressed some level of support for the QAnon conspiracy theory, which got its start on far-right message boards, are now serving in state legislatures throughout the United States. The QAnon conspiracy theory revolves around an anonymous account known as “Q,” who claimed to have an inside scoop showing former President Donald Trump had a secret plot that would take down his perceived enemies, the “deep state,” and a cabal of Democratic pedophiles. Some supporters of QAnon have been tied to violent incidents and participated in the January 6 insurrection at the U.S...."

Immediately upon taking office, President Joe Biden removed President Donald Trump’s designation of Portland, Oregon, as a jurisdiction in anarchy. So, how are things going now? Anarchy reigns in the City of Roses. Over the weekend, police were called to 19 shootings. One of which is likely to be ruled a double homicide, bringing the total number of murders in Portland this year to 71, surpassing the 1987 record of 70.

Tuesday night was a disaster for Democrats nationally. Period. Losing the Virginia governor's race in a state that President Joe Biden had won by 10 percentage points just a year earlier was bad enough. But the surprising closeness of the New Jersey governor's race -- coupled with the rejection of a ballot measure to replace the police department in Minneapolis -- suggests that there is broad dissatisfaction in the country for how Democrats have handled the power given to them in 2020.

Vicious infighting within his own party has threatened to torpedo his ambitious domestic agenda, encapsulated in two sprawling pieces of legislation that Democrats have not yet been able to vote out of Congress. Even before the bickering over the bills, Biden's claim to competence, based on more than 40 years in Washington, had been shredded by a calamitous exit from Afghanistan and an ongoing crisis..."

It may not be a presidential or midterm election year, but 2021 has its fair share of important votes happening on Tuesday. Virginia’s gubernatorial election is clearly the most noteworthy race, but several other elections — from legislative races to mayoral campaigns to ballot measures to special elections — could have big consequences as well.  Tuesday’s main event will happen in Virginia, where Democratic former Gov.

The story is the same as thousands that precede it. Gruden is just another scalp on the woke culture warriors’ walls. The New York Times is proud of their reporting that brought down the Super Bowl-winning coach. There’s nothing new to these cancellation tactics, and we’ll see the cackling hyenas in the left-wing press pursue more scalps in the near future. This story does, however, reveal the warped moral..."

Yom Kippur, 2019. I wore white, as is my custom, and didn’t shower, apply creams, or wear leather. These are the tools the tradition offers to playact our mortality. But I didn’t need them. I was two months past a major surgery, one month into chemotherapy, and fully aware of my own vulnerability and weakness and the possibility of death. Sitting alone, forcing myself to eat and drink as my doctor had commanded, I prayed for my life. The psychotherapist Irvin Yalom, in his book Love’s Executioner, writes: We know about death, intellectually..."

Tuesday night was a disaster for Democrats nationally. Period. Losing the Virginia governor's race in a state that President Joe Biden had won by 10 percentage points just a year earlier was bad enough. But the surprising closeness of the New Jersey governor's race -- coupled with the rejection of a ballot measure to replace the police department in Minneapolis -- suggests that there is broad dissatisfaction in the country for how Democrats have handled the power given to them in 2020. Below are five reasons why now is the time..."

Virginia will have the eyes of the political world on it Tuesday night. Most of the attention will be on the marquee gubernatorial election between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin. Less watched, but important for its national implications, are the elections for the 100 seats in the House of Delegates. If the polls are to be believed, Republicans are going to do very well in Virginia given the political baseline in the state. Traditionally, this would foretell a strong Republican performance in next year's midterms. In fact, given Virginia is more blue than..."

J​​oe Biden's presidency was meant to be defined by calm, experienced competence. Yet just nine months into his term, he has been teetering on the brink of failure. Vicious infighting within his own party has threatened to torpedo his ambitious domestic agenda, encapsulated in two sprawling pieces of legislation that Democrats have not yet been able to vote out of Congress. Even before the bickering over the bills, Biden's claim to competence, based on more than 40 years in Washington, had been shredded by a calamitous exit from Afghanistan and an ongoing crisis..."

In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, first reported by PBS, Daniel Foote said he was resigning immediately “with deep disappointment and apologies to those seeking crucial changes.” “I will not be associated with the United States inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs to..."

It's an issue the court repeatedly ducked after issuing a landmark 5-4 ruling in 2008 that said the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep a handgun at home for self defense.

The court's decision to consider the issue on an unusually accelerated schedule ramps up the drama over abortion, as the justices prepare to hear an even more consequential case a month from now.

The Supreme Court handed down a brief opinion on Monday holding that a California police officer is immune from a lawsuit alleging he used excessive force while helping arrest an armed suspect. Though the Court’s decision in Rivas-Villegas v.

The Supreme Court heard oral argument on Monday in two challenges to S.B. 8, the Texas law that bans almost all abortions in the state. After nearly three hours of argument by four different lawyers, the justices appeared likely to allow the case brought by a group of Texas abortion providers to go forward, even if they did not necessarily appear to agree on the rationale for that lawsuit. The justices were more skeptical about the lawsuit filed by the Biden administration, and they did not give any hint as..."

The focus will not be on abortion rights, per se, but on the controversial Texas law designed to prevent court challenges.

The far-left fumed over an initial draft from Democrat President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court Commission on the issue of packing the Supreme Court, an idea that the report cautioned against. “Court expansion is likely to undermine, rather than enhance, the Supreme Court’s legitimacy and its role in the constitutional system, and there are significant reasons to be skeptical that expansion would serve democratic values,” the report said, later adding, “Court expansion today could lead to a continuous cycle of future expansions.” The Washington Post noted that the push from the far-left to expand..."

Just over the past week, a billionaire wealth tax proposal has suddenly moved from the edge to the very center of the negotiating table for President Biden’s sweeping Build Back Better agenda. What explains the shift? The reasons are both negative and positive. On the negative side: Kyrsten Sinema.

The 1684-page bill, released Thursday, comes just one day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., signaled optimism that various factions of the Democratic caucus were close to reaching a deal on the legislation. ""As we have insisted, we are close to agreement on the priorities and the topline of the legislation, which can and must pass the House and Senate,"" Pelosi said in a letter to Democrats Wednesday.

The Constitution authorizes three forms of taxation, and tax-law gurus interviewed by the Free Beacon said the ill-fated billionaire's tax did not fit neatly in any of those categories. The measure would have taxed assets that appreciate in value year over year—like a stock or a closely held company—which aren't currently taxed until they're sold. Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) on Wednesday morning unveiled the billionaire's tax..."
1378,The Zillow Tax,National Review,https://www.allsides.com/news/2021-10-27-1522/zillow-tax,"OPINION
The year 2021 has seen President Biden and congressional Democrats explore, very publicly and painfully, seemingly every possible way to squeeze more tax money out of the American people. This exploration has taken place though the federal government just enjoyed the biggest revenue haul in two decades, inflation is higher than it’s been in three decades, and Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) has taken all tax-rate increases off the table. Desperate for any new tax at this late hour of the “Build Back Better” soap opera of socialism, all hands have come on deck for perhaps the..."

President Joe Biden got himself elected partly by opposing the billionaires' wealth tax proposed during the primary campaign by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.). Now, in a reversal, Biden is preparing to embrace the idea. It wouldn't be the first time that a presidential candidate's plans changed after getting elected. The shamelessness of the way that Biden has shifted on the issue, though, is something else. It risks undercutting Biden's claim to being a voice of moderation. It also may reinforce voter cynicism. How's democracy supposed to..."

The president said this week he has agreed to cut the mammoth $3.5 trillion price tag, and reports have suggested lawmakers will land somewhere between $1.75 trillion and $1.9 trillion. But some Democratic legislators, like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Az., have said they will not agree to a package that includes tax hikes on corporations and high earners. Here’s how the Biden administration has proposed paying for the package: Minimum corporate..."

Political movements often run out of gas, but rarely do they stomp on the brakes and shift in rapid reverse. This month marks the ninth anniversary of the virtual Tea Party takeover of Congress. In 2010, more than 40 Tea Party Republicans were elected to the House promising to, among other things, lower national debt, reduce the power of the federal government, and support an originalist interpretation of the Constitution. Now the Tea Party is essentially over, the movement degraded by its own hypocrisy."

Being told what to do by epidemiologists and officials wielding SCIENCE as their authority has been enough to bring Tea Party–era liberty back in vogue. It’s 2009 again, or feels like it. That was when spontaneous, grassroots protests against overweening government sprang up and were widely derided in the media as dangerous and wrong-headed. The protesters then were inveighing against Obamacare; the protesters now are striking out against the coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown agitation shows that, despite the revolution in Republican politics wrought by President Donald Trump, opposition to government..."

In the early chapters of his letter to the Romans, St. Paul describes how humanity stands condemned before God’s law, guilty of falling short of the justice we were made for.

Never mind the charges against Trump for his role in allegedly inciting a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, GOP senators and Trump's lawyers say, because the trial itself is unconstitutional.

No one knows whether the Constitution permits the Senate to hold an impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump, now that he no longer holds office. To be sure, there is a bevy of legal scholarship discussing this question. And, as a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service notes, “most scholars who have closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.” But while the Constitution mentions impeachment six times, the text of the..."

We look where a cycle of partisanship may head. After two tumultuous impeachments of former President Donald Trump in little over a year, it’s clear that today the impeachment process works far differently than the Founding Fathers intended. The authors of the Constitution believed that members of Congress would rally together to defend the legislature’s prerogatives against intrusions from the executive.

Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 after a fiery speech in which the then president repeated his false claims that his Nov. 3 election defeat was the result of widespread fraud and urging them to “fight like hell (or) you’re not going to have a country anymore.” The unprecedented..."

The 360,https://www.allsides.com/news/2021-01-27-0526/it-time-get-rid-filibuster,"Democrats hold a legislative trifecta — majorities in both houses of Congress, plus the presidency — for the first time since the beginning of the Obama administration. In theory, a unified Democratic caucus should be able to pass whatever it wants and Republicans would be powerless to stop them. But there’s one procedural tool that the GOP could use to prevent many of those plans from becoming law: the Senate filibuster. The filibuster allows any individual senator to block a bill from reaching a final up-or-down vote unless three-fifths of..."

The pardon power granted by the U.S. Constitution is incredibly broad, but the question of whether presidents can pardon themselves has never been tested. Trump has reportedly been “obsessed” with the idea of a self-pardon for years and has publicly stated that he has the “absolute right” to issue one. Earlier this week,..."

There was the stunningly backward plan to draw down forces before evacuating civilians and diplomats, which led to the mind-blowing Bagram bug-out. Thus the domino effect of U.S. mistakes: our inability to evacuate from a fortified, well-equipped airport, instead shifting operations to the impractical Kabul airport; our removal of the technical support (especially air support) that the Afghan..."

The changes mean the Consumer Product Safety Commission no longer plans in the coming year to draw up new mandatory rules for preventing suffocation in infant nursing pillows or carbon monoxide poisoning from gas appliances.

Democrats are terrified of what the future holds for them in the United States Senate. The party currently controls half the seats in the chamber, giving them, with Vice President Harris’s tie-breaking vote, the narrowest possible majority. But some in the party — like pollster David Shor, recently profiled by Ezra Klein in the New York Times — believe demographic trends put Democrats at grave risk of falling into a deep hole over the next two election cycles. That risk exists even if Democrats continue to win more votes nationwide. “If 2024..."

According to the report, several agencies, including the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services have been parties to the settlement discussion, according to people close to the talks who spoke with The Journal.

Former President Donald Trump ended his presidency more unpopular than any of the last 12 presidents at the end of their first terms and he is still unpopular post-presidency according to FiveThirtyEight’s new average of Trump’s favorability numbers. Currently, 41.4 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the former president, while 53 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. Overall, Trump’s unfavorability — now that he’s out of office we’re tracking his favorability numbers rather than his approval rating, both of which capture popularity — has remained steady just as his low approval..."

For very good reason, the media and Democrats feel threatened and terrified by the “Let’s go, Brandon!” chant, which is why we must never stop saying it. If the organized left understands nothing else, it understands the power that comes when normal, everyday people realize they are not alone. This is why, among the joyless left, there was a weekend-wide, five-alarm freakout over a Southwest Airlines pilot reportedly saying over the intercom, “Let’s go, Brandon.” Before I go any further, it’s important to point out that this particular pilot incident..."

Steve Daines blasted the White House on Friday for “virtue signaling” on climate change ahead of President Biden’s appearance at the United Nations Climate Summit in Scotland. Mr. Daines, a Montana Republican, penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen excoriating her recent decision to designate climate change as an “emerging threat” to U.S. financial stability. In his letter, a copy of which was obtained exclusively by The Washington Times, Mr. Daines said the move amounted to little more than “virtue signaling.” “It is unclear to me that this..."

Gender strategy? Yes, the “National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality,” the first-ever such declaration because in the near-quarter millennium of this country’s existence no one ever thought we needed one, lays out a list of goals and aspirations and solutions to alleged problems whose existence keeps being asserted without evidence. “Health care,” for instance, is..."

The number of women in prison has skyrocketed over the last 40 years. Despite critical state level criminal justice reforms designed to keep people out of prison, both sexes have not benefited equally. Women currently go to prison at twice the rate of men. And now, a new threat to the over-prosecution and incarceration of women looms large in the, perhaps, unexpected forum of reproductive rights. This year alone, state legislators have introduced nearly 600 abortion restrictions, with more than 90 becoming law, according to Planned Parenthood. Some of these laws,..."

The brief ruling is a blow to abortion rights advocates, who had hoped to suspend the law for as long as possible while its constitutionality is debated in the courts.  The three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1. The Department of Justice, which sued Texas over the law, is able to appeal the..."

The decision Thursday could push the law closer to returning to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has already once allowed the restrictions to take effect without ruling on its constitutionality. The Texas law bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant. Since the law took effect in..."

When the Taliban first imposed its vision for Afghanistan’s cultural and political landscape between 1996 and 2001, the country’s women were subjected to wide-ranging forms of gender-based hardships. In addition to policies—like mandatory burqas, education bans, and forced isolation— designed to expel 50 percent of the population from the public eye and positions of power, Afghan women suffered rampant sexual assault, the very thing the former decrees ostensibly protected against.  With the fall of Kabul and the Taliban’s formation of an all-male “interim” government, the jihadist group’s treatment of women..."
